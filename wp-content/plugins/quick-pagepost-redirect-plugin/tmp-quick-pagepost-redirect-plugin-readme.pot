msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "SECOND - if you are using Quick Redirects, try using links relative to the root (so 'http://mysite.com/contact/' would be '/contact/' if using the root path). If your site is in a sub-folder (set in Settings/General), do not use the sub-folder in the root path as it is already taken into consideration by WordPress."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "NEXT - clear your site's cache files if you are using a caching plugin/theme. You may also need to clear your browser cache and internet files if you use caching - the browser WILL hold cached versions of a page and not redirect if there was no redirect in the cached version."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "FINALLY - if you are not using a permalink structure of some sort, it is recommended that you set up at least a basic one. Redirects without a permalink structure can be inconsistant."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "If your page or post is still not redirecting, then it is most likely because something else like the theme functions file or another plugin is outputting the header BEFORE the plugin can perform the redirect. This can be tested by turning off all plugins except the Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin and testing if the redirect works. many time a plugin or bad code is the culprit - or the redirect is just simply turned off."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "We have tested the plugin in dozens of themes and a whole lot more plugins. In our experience, (with exception to a few bugs) many times another plugin or the theme scripting is the problem. If you do notice a problem, please let us know at plugins@fischercreativemedia.com - along with the WP version, theme you are using and plugins you have installed - and we will try to troubleshoot the problem."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Yes, you can, but you do not always need to. If you are redirecting to an external URL, then yes. If you are just redirecting to another page or post on your site, then no, it is not needed. When in doubt, use the entire URL. For Quick Redirects, it is recommended that you use relative URLs whenever possible."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Yes. You can perform a 301 Permanent Redirect. Additionally, you can select a 302 Temporary or a 307 Temporary redirect or a Meta redirect. Quick Redirects are always 301 unless you override them with a filter."

msgid "If you use a redirect of 301 AND the content on the destination URL is the same as the original page (just a different URL), then allof the ranking and 'link juice', as they say, will stay with the page."

msgid "YES... and NO... The redirect will always work on a Published Post/Page. For it to work correctly on a Post/Page in DRAFT status, you need to fist publish the page, then re-save it as a draft. If you don't follow that step, you will get a 404 error."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "YES, you can add a ' rel=\"nofollow\" ' attribute for the redirect link. Simply check the \"add rel=nofollow\" box when setting up the redirect on the page/post edit page.

msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Good question! The number corresponds with the header code that is returned to the browser when the page is first accessed. A good page, meaning something was found, returns a 200 status code and that tells the browser to go ahead and keep loading the content for the page. If nothing is found a 404 error is returned (and we have ALL seen these - usually it is a bad link or a page was moved). There are many other types of codes, but those are the most common."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "The 300+ range of codes in the header tells the browser (and search engine spider) that the original page has moved to a new location - this can be just a new file name a new folder or a completely different site."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "A 301 code means that you want to tell the browser (or Google, bing, etc.) that your new page has permanently moved to a new location. This is great for search engines because it lets them know that there was a page there once, but now go to the new place to get it - and they update there old link to is so future visitors will not have to go through the same process."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "A 302 or 307 code tell the browser that the file was there but TEMPORARILY it can be found at a new location. This will tell the search engines to KEEP the old link in place because SOME day it will be back at the same old link. There is only a slight difference between a 302 and a 307 status. Truth is, 302 is more widely used, so unless you know why you need a 307, stick with a 302."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Easiest way to decide is this: If you want the page to permanently change to a new spot, use 301. If you are editing the page or post and only want it to be down for a few hours, minutes, days or weeks and plan on putting it back with the same link as before, then us 302. If you are having trouble with the redirects, use a <code>meta</code> redirect. The meta redirect actually starts to load the page as a 200 good status, then redirects using a meta redirect tag."
