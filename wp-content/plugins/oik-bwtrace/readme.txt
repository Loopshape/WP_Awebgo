== Description ==
Debug trace for WordPress. 

* The primary purpose of debug trace is to help in the development of PHP code: plugins or themes.
* The primary purpose of action trace is to help you understand the sequence of events in the server.
* This plugin provides the admin interface to trace functions and action and filter tracing built into plugins that use the oik / bw APIs.

Except for HTML comments, neither oik bwtrace nor oik action trace alters the output of your web pages.
They write their output to a file on the server which you can browse in a separate window.

You can also use the oik trace facilities to assist in problem determination in a live site.


Features:

* Easy to code APIs: bw_trace2(), bw_backtrace() and bw_trace()
* Tracing can be enabled programmatically
* Does not require WP_DEBUG to be defined
* Dynamically activates trace functions
* Implemented as lazy just-in-time code
* Provides contextual information
* Action trace counts help you understand the sequence of actions and filters
* Can be used during regression testing
* Traces ALL server functionality, including AJAX and other background requests
* Minimum performance overhead when tracing is not enabled
* Can be activated in wp-config.php and db.php to trace code before WordPress is fully loaded
* Does not need to be activated if started programmatically or from wp-config.php
* Ability to choose the IP address to trace, defaults to ALL requests
* Writes summary trace record for each transaction into a daily log
* Now operates as a standalone plugin; independent of the oik base plugin
* Integrated with oik-lib shared library management
* Backtraces deprecated logic messages
* Traces and backtraces PHP Error, Warning and Notice messages
* API supports multiple trace levels
* Supports tracing of user defined hooks


The trace record output can include:

* Fully qualified source file name
* Trace record count
* Time stamp
* Current filter information
* Number of database queries that have been performed.
* Current post ID
* Current and peak memory usage (in bytes)
* Files loaded count
* Contextual information

The output for action tracing can include trace records showing:

* Count of action hooks and filters
* Invocation of the 'wp' actions
* Contents of the global wp_rewrite for the 'wp' action
* Summary reports at 'shutdown'
* Information about deprecated logic
* Information related to Errors, Warnings and Notices

New in v2.0.6

* Parameters passed to user selected hooks
* Returned values from user selected filters
* Current status of the global post object for user selected hooks
* Information about attached hook functions for user selected hooks

If you select "Trace 'shutdown' status report and log in summary file"
then you also get a daily summary log, named bwtrace.vt.mmdd

The summary daily log contains information that can be used for performance analysis.
This log is produced even when tracing is not enabled.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where is the FAQ? =
[oik-bwtrace FAQ](http://www.oik-plugins.com/oik-plugins/oik-bwtrace-debug-trace-for-wordpress/?oik-tab=faq)

= Can I get support? = 
Use the contact form on the oik-plugins website. 

== Is there a tutorial? ==
See this page and short video
[Introduction to oik-bwtrace](http://www.oik-plugins.com/wordpress-plugins-from-oik-plugins/free-oik-plugins/oik-trace-plugin/an-introduction-to-problem-determination-with-oik-bwtrace-debug-trace-for-wordpress)

== How do I trace from startup? ==

If we want to include bw_trace(), bw_trace2() or bw_backtrace() calls in WordPress core 
then we need to define the functions, so we include /libs/bwtrace.php.

If we want trace and action count to be enabled and reset at WordPress startup then we also need to define these as TRUE

Put the following in your wp-config.php file

`define( 'BW_TRACE_CONFIG_STARTUP', true );
define( 'BW_TRACE_ON', true );
define( 'BW_COUNT_ON', true );
define( 'BW_TRACE_RESET', true );

if ( file_exists( ABSPATH . '/wp-content/plugins/oik-bwtrace/lib/bwtrace.php' ) ) { 
  require_once( ABSPATH . '/wp-content/plugins/oik-bwtrace/lib/bwtrace.php' );
}  
`

Don't forget to remove or comment out this code when you no longer need it.
